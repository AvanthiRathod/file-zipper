## 🗜 File Zipper

- Created a *File Zipper* tool using Python to compress and decompress files. 📂➡🗜
- The program efficiently zips multiple files into a single .zip archive using the zipfile module.
- It also provides functionality to unzip and extract files from a .zip archive to a specified directory. 📤
- This project is an excellent exercise in file handling and working with Python's built-in libraries. 🧑‍💻
- Ideal for anyone looking to automate file compression tasks or learn about file manipulation in Python! 🎉
